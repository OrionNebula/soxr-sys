# soxr-sys

Autogenerated Rust bindings for the [SoX resampler library](https://sourceforge.net/projects/soxr/).

## Comparison with libsoxr-sys

[`libsoxr-sys`](https://github.com/lrbalt/libsoxr-sys) is an alternate libsoxr binding for Rust. This library aims for compatibility with `libsoxr-sys` (by enabling the `compatibility` feature) while also adding additional features and tweaks:

* Bindings generated at compile time via a build script + a git submodule, for easy upgrades and consistent versioning, even if the platform's `libsoxr` version changes
* Support for static linking via the `static` feature

If the `compatibility` feature is disabled, the following style changes are made:

* Enums use the `ModuleConsts` style rather than living at the top level
* Enums are `u64` to match the `libsoxr` API, avoiding some casts
* Use of an explicit `size_t` type instead of `usize`
